1. The code prints "3". This is true because var had different scope than lets and const. JS can access var outside of the for loop.

2. The code prints "150". There is no error because variables declared with the var keyword can be accessed outside of the for loop.

3. The code prints "150". This happens because finalPrice is declared in the scope of the console.log command.

4. The code prints nothing. This is true because there is no console.log statement and return values are not automatically printed in JS.

5. The code prints nothing. This is the case because there is never a function call outside of the function definition. This means none of the code in discountPrices ever runs.

6. The code causes the error: "ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined." The let keyword does not allow the variable to be called outside of the for loop where it is declared.

7. The function prints "150." finalCount is declared with let outside the for loop, so the console.log command can access the finalCount variable.

8. The function prints nothing because there is no console.log command in the code.

9. The function returns the error: "ReferenceError: i is not defined". This is true because i is declared using the let keyword within the for loop. Therefore, it cannnot be called outside the for loop.
